Parts 1-3 have makefiles, to compile simply run "make" and then run the output executable, ie, ./OUTPUT_NAME

For part 4, compile with nvcc
To compile and generate a file with output name OUTPUT_NAME.o run the following:
nvcc group19_part4.cu -o OUTPUT_NAME.o

To run on an NVIDIA device simply execute
./OUTPUT_NAME.o

Part 4 code generates 3 txt files
Adata.txt - contains the random generated elements, 1 per line
Bdata.txt - contains the index of an element from A that is followed by a duplicate of itself, 1 per line
Cdata.txt - contains the elements from A with duplicates remove, 1 per line
